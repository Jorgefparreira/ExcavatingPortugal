Inside these, the team found several walls made of irregular blocks of stone, without the use of any mortar, that had been severely affected by the construction of modern houses. Considerable quantities of pottery recovered from layers associated with these structures permitted their dating to the XVI and XVII centuries, mainly due to the presence of faience with manganese decorations.","images":[{"image1":"img/peniche1.jpg","image2":"img/peniche2.jpg","image3":"img/peniche3.jpg","image4":"img/peniche4.jpg"}]},{"id":"dig2","name":"Coming Soon","name2":"Praça Dom Luís I, Lisbon","anchor":"#!excavation/1","coverImage":"img/image_2.jpg","notice":"Please see","link":"Rua Afonso de Albuquerque,Peniche","anchor2":"#!excavation/0"},{"id":"dig3","name":"Coming Soon","name2":"Rua dos Douradores, Lisbon","anchor":"#!excavation/2","coverImage":"img/image_3.jpg","notice":"Please see","link":"Rua Afonso de Albuquerque,Peniche","anchor2":"#!excavation/0"},{"id":"dig4","name":"Coming Soon","name2":"Water Treatment Plant, V.
